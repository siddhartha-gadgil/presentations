					<li> Generative AI has become a popular sensation. </li>
					<li class="fragment"> In particular Large Language Models can generate code, database queries etc. </li>
					<li class="fragment">Much less well known are the major advances in computer proofs, both within
						mathematics and in industry.</li>
					<li class="fragment"> Computer proofs complement very well generative AI. </li>
					<li class="fragment"> I will describe computer proofs, generative AI and how they work together.

				<h4>Another proof: infinitely many primes</h4>

					<li class="fragment">A formal proof can be easily checked by a computer or a human.</li>

					<li class="fragment"> Writing (and checking) a fully formal proof is difficult and tedious except in

					<li class="fragment">We <strong>specify</strong> (describe) software, hardware, networking protocols, cryptographic protocols, even tax codes in precise mathematical terms.

					<li class="fragment">We give <strong>mathematical proofs</strong> of correct behaviour, which are

				<h4>TimSort</h4>
				<ul>

					<li class="fragment">Tim Peters developed the Timsort hybrid sorting algorithm in 2002 &ndash; a
						clever combination of ideas from merge sort and insertion sort designed to perform well on real
						world data.
					</li>
					<li class="fragment">This was initially developed for Python, but was ported to Java and was used as
						the default sorting algorithm for Android SDK, Sunâ€™s JDK and OpenJDK.
					</li>
					<li class="fragment">This means that the number of computers, cloud services and mobile phones that
						use TimSort for sorting is well into the billions.</li>

				<h4>Formal methods</h4>
				<ul>

					<li class="fragment">Having successfully computer verified Counting and Radix sort implementations
						in Java, the European <em>envisage</em> group turned to verifying TimSort.
					</li>
					<li class="fragment">They were not able to verify correctness.
					</li>
					<li class="fragment">A closer analysis showed that this was because the algorithm was wrong.</li>
					<li class="fragment">The researchers could find, and suggest a fix for, the bug.</li>

					The storage team, for example, is able to be much more agile and be much more aggressive in the

			<section data-transition="concave" data-background-color="#002b36">
				<ul>
					<li><em>Interactive Theorem Provers</em> are software systems where proofs are
						obtained by human-machine
						collaboration.</li>
					<li class="fragment">The computer both finds (parts of) proofs and verifies
						<strong>correctness</strong>.
					</li>
					<li class="fragment">With interactive theorem provers, mathematics on a large scale can be digitied
						(<em>formalized</em>) in a modular fashion, with the automation greatly facilitating this.
					</li>
					<li class="fragment">Indeed the <em>Lean Mathematical Library</em> has most undergraduate
						mathematics in it, and some advanced topics.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section data-transition="concave" data-background-color="#002b36">
				<ul>
					<li>As more mathematics is in such libraries, it becomes easier and more enjoyable to formalize even
						more.</li>
					<li class="fragment">Automation is also improving, which also facilitates formalization.
					</li>
					<li class="fragment"><strong>Lean 4</strong> is a <em>programming language</em> seamlessly integrated with an <em>interactive
						theorem prover</em>, which helps with formalization and makes it useful in new ways.
					</li>
					<li class="fragment">The main current application of Lean is to ensure a super-human
						level of correctness.

					<li class="fragment"> One hopes this is without super-human
						effort.

				<h4>Who guards the guards?</h4>
				<ul>
					<li class="fragment">
						A computer verified proof is only as trustworthy as the system that verified the proof.
					</li>
					<li class="fragment">
						Following the <em>de Bruijn</em> principle, proofs are <em>verified</em> by a small
						<em>trusted
							kernel</em>, which can be thoroughly checked.
					</li>
					<li class="fragment">
						For example, the Lean theorem prover has four (small) proof checkers written in
						four languages.
					</li>
					<li class="fragment">
						In a specific case, one only has to check that the <strong>definitions</strong> and the
						<strong>statement</strong> are correct, which is typically not hard especially if they use a
						library.
					</li>

			<section data-transition="concave" data-background-color="#002b36">
				<h4>The Liquid Tensor experiment</h4>
				<ul>
					<li class="fragment">In December 2020, Peter Scholze challenged the formalization community to
						computer verify a foundational theorem of <em>Condensed
							Mathematics</em>.</li>
					<blockquote class="fragment">
						â€” with this theorem, the hope that the condensed formalism can be fruitfully applied to real
						functional analysis stands or falls. I think the theorem is of utmost foundational importance,
						so being 99.9% sure is not enough.
					</blockquote>

				</ul>
			</section>
			<section data-background-color="#002b36">
				<ul>
					<li>This was taken up by the Lean community led by Johann Commelin, with active
						collaboration from Scholze.</li>

					<li class="fragment">
						In about six months a major step, <strong>Theorem 9.4</strong> of Scholze's notes, was proved.
					</li>
					<li class="fragment">
						Scholze said this was the part where he was worried about, and that he was now satisfied
						that
						the correctness of his result was checked.
					</li>
					<li class="fragment">
						About an year later, the origin goal, <strong>Theorem 9.1</strong> was proved in Lean.

					<li class="fragment">Scholze said he understood aspects of his proof after the formalization which
						he hadn't earlier.</li>

			<section data-background-color="#002b36">
				<h4>Sums of reciprocals</h4>
				<ul>

					<li class="fragment">
						In December 2021, Thomas Bloom proved that any set of natural numbers of positive upper
						density
						contains a finite subset whose reciprocals add up to $1$, answering a question of ErdÅ‘s and
						Graham.
					</li>
					<li class="fragment">
						While his paper was still under review, Thomas Bloom
						learnt Lean, and,
						along with Bhavik Mehta, formalized this theorem in Lean.

			<section data-background-color="#002b36">
				<h4>Kaplansky's Unit Conjecture</h4>
				<ul>

					<li class="fragment">
						About an year ago, Giles Gardam disproved the long-standing <strong>Kaplansky's Unit
							Conjecture</strong>, which asserted that group rings of torsion-free groups over fields
						do
						not have non-trivial units.
					</li>
					<li class="fragment">
						Gardam used a SAT solver to find such non-trivial units for a specific group and the field
						$\mathbb{F}_2$.
					</li>
					<li class="fragment">
						Anand Rao Tadipatri and I formalized the proof in Lean 4 using its integration of programs and
						proofs.

				</ul>
			</section>

			<section data-background-color="#002b36">
				<ul>
					<li>As these examples show, the effort for formalization of mathematics is rapidly decreasing.</li>
					<li class="fragment">Mathematics in Lean is much better structured than the human literature.</li>
					<li class="fragment">Lean also has powerful automation, which helps formalization.</li>
					<li class="fragment">All this paves the way (one hopes) for facilitating mathematical discovery.

				<h4>Minerva</h4>

					<li class="fragment">Minerva is a Large Language Model (LLM) capable of solving mathematical and scientific questions using step-by-step reasoning.</li>
					<li class="fragment">It can answer reasonably complex problems, including some JEE Mains questions.</li>
					<li class="fragment">Minerva uses various techniques such as:

							<li>few-shot prompting,</li>
							<li>chain of thought or scratchpad prompting,</li>

			<section data-background-color="teal">
				<h4>Draft, Sketch and Prove</h4>
				<ul>
					<li class="fragment">A Large Language Model is used to generate an informal sketch of a proof.</li>

				<h4>Conclusions</h4>
				<ul>
					<li class="fragment">Generative AI has the promise of hugely increasing the productivity of many people.</li>
