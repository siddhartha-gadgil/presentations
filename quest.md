> What are examples of difficult sensorimotor tasks that humans can perform well?

Some examples of difficult sensorimotor tasks that humans can perform well include:

Juggling multiple objects
Playing a musical instrument
Typing on a keyboard
Riding a bicycle
Performing a gymnastics routine
Playing sports such as basketball or soccer
Threading a needle
Performing a surgery
Dancing
Playing video games
Riding a horse
Painting or drawing
Carpentry or woodworking
Playing a video game
Making a pottery
All of these tasks involve coordination of various body parts, precise movements, and the ability to make adjustments based on feedback from the environment.

> What are the relations of the above to the Moravec paradox and Kahnemann's "thinking fast and slow"

The Moravec paradox states that while humans find it easy to perform difficult sensorimotor tasks (such as playing a musical instrument or juggling), we find it difficult to perform tasks that are easy for computers (such as performing complex calculations). The tasks that I listed as examples of difficult sensorimotor tasks that humans can perform well align with this paradox, as they involve coordination of various body parts, precise movements, and the ability to make adjustments based on feedback from the environment. These tasks are relatively easy for humans to perform, but difficult for computers to replicate.

> Why do you consider the linguistic tasks as "slow thinking". Are they not automatic and intuitive

I apologize for the confusion. The linguistic tasks that I listed as examples of difficult linguistic tasks that humans can perform well, such as understanding and producing idioms, puns, and sarcasm, understanding and producing non-literal language, understanding and producing metaphorical language, understanding and producing nuanced, implicit meaning, are indeed intuitive and automatic, and are considered as "fast thinking" tasks. They are performed quickly and unconsciously, without much conscious thought or effort. They require a deep understanding and mastery of the language.

On the other hand, tasks such as Translating between languages, Summarizing a complex text, Writing poetry or creative fiction, requires more deliberate and reflective thinking, and are considered as "slow thinking" tasks. They require more conscious thought and effort, as well as the ability to make connections between different pieces of information, to understand and use language in creative and flexible ways.

> What is the analogy between machine learning and Kahnemann's Systems 1 and 2

Kahneman's "thinking fast and slow" theory describes two different modes of thinking that humans use: "System 1" thinking, which is intuitive and automatic, and "System 2" thinking, which is deliberate and reflective. These two systems can be compared to the way machine learning models process information.

In machine learning, a model's ability to perform a task can be thought of as its "System 1" thinking. These models are trained to perform specific tasks, such as image classification or language translation, and can perform these tasks quickly and accurately, without much conscious thought or effort. These models are good at recognizing patterns and making predictions based on past data, similar to the way humans use their intuition to make quick judgments.

On the other hand, the process of designing and improving a machine learning model can be thought of as its "System 2" thinking. This process requires deliberate and reflective thinking, as it involves understanding the problem, designing the model architecture, selecting the appropriate algorithm, fine-tuning the model's parameters, and evaluating its performance. This process is more complex and require more conscious thought and effort, similar to the way humans use their rational thinking to solve problems.

In summary, the analogy between machine learning and Kahnemann's Systems 1 and 2 is that System 1 thinking can be thought of as a model's ability to perform a task, while System 2 thinking can be thought of as the process of designing and improving a model.

>What are additional traits, besides intuitive and automatic, of Kahnemann's system 1

In addition to being intuitive and automatic, Kahneman's System 1 thinking is also characterized by the following traits:

It is fast: System 1 thinking is quick and efficient, allowing us to make judgments and decisions quickly.
It is effortless: System 1 thinking requires little conscious effort, and is often performed unconsciously.
It is emotional: System 1 thinking is closely connected to our emotions, and our judgments and decisions are often influenced by our feelings.
It is holistic: System 1 thinking tends to process information holistically, taking into account the overall context and patterns, rather than individual details.
It is unconscious: System 1 thinking is not accessible to introspection, meaning that we are not aware of the mental processes that underlie it.
In summary, System 1 thinking is intuitive, automatic, fast, effortless, emotional, holistic, and unconscious. It is the mode of thinking that allows us to make quick judgments and decisions, based on our past experiences and emotions, without much conscious thought or effort.




> How is it related to analogies?

System 1 thinking is closely related to the ability to make analogies, as it allows us to quickly recognize patterns and make connections between different pieces of information. An analogy is a comparison between two things, typically for the purpose of explanation or clarification. Analogies rely on our ability to recognize similarities and correspondences between the things being compared, and this ability is closely connected to our System 1 thinking.

For example, when we use the analogy "the brain is like a computer", we are making a comparison between the brain and a computer based on the similarities in their functions, such as processing information and storing data. This analogy allows us to better understand the brain by making connections to something that we already have an understanding of.

Analogies are also used in teaching and learning, as they can help to explain complex concepts in a way that is easier to understand. For example, a teacher might use the analogy "DNA is like a recipe" to help students understand the structure and function of DNA. This analogy allows students to make connections between the familiar concept of a recipe and the more complex concept of DNA.

In summary, the ability to make analogies is closely related to System 1 thinking, as it allows us to quickly recognize patterns and make connections between different pieces of information, which is a key trait of System 1 thinking.
