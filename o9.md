# Computer Proofs and Artificial Intelligence

Agenda:

* Overview
* Computer proofs
    - Proofs: Human and Computer.
    - Computer proofs in Industry.
    - Automating mathematical proofs?
* Using Language models
    - Strengths and Weaknesses.
    - Synthesizing computer proofs and programs.
    - More effective use of language models.

## Overview

* Language models have become a sensation.
* They have many strengths and can be a tool for greatly increasing productivity.
* However, they have some weaknesses - especially a poor judgement of what is correct.
* At the same time, *computer proofs* with *interactive theorem provers* have matured - especially with the Lean theorem prover and its mathematics library.
* These complement language models naturally.
* The way these interact may have lessons for more effective use of language models.

## Computer Proofs

* Proofs: Formal and Informal
* Mathematical objects: includes software, networking protocols, hardware design, etc.
* Logical proofs: FOL, DTT, etc.
* Proofs in practice
* Computer proofs
* Example: TimSort - http://www.envisage-project.eu/proving-android-java-and-python-sorting-algorithm-is-broken-and-how-to-fix-it/
* Byron Cook (AWS): The storage team, for example, is able to be much more agile and be much more aggressive in the programs that they write because of the formal methods. They're able to write code that otherwise they might not want to deploy because they wouldn't be as confident about it, and they're deploying four times as fast.
* When are computer proofs worthwhile?
* When do we need to be completely correct always?
* Why should we trust the software.
* Theorem provers:
    - SAT Solvers, Resolution theorem provers: autonomous, not scalable
    - Interactive theorem provers: scalable, not autonomous
* For success of Interactive theorem provers, need:
    - Good automation
    - Good user interface
    - Good libraries: chicken and egg problem
* Lean theorem prover and its mathematics library
    - Lean is an interactive theorem prover based on *Calculus of Inductive Constructions* (like Coq, Agda).
    - Hence, proofs in Lean are not too far informal proofs.
    - Mathlib includes most undergraduate mathematics and many advanced topics.
    - Recent important results have been formalized in Lean, including ones where Peter Scholze was worried about correctness.
    - Lean 4 is also a fast programming language.
* Levels of verification
    - syntax in Python etc.
    - strongly typed languages
    - formal verification

## Using Language Models

* Large Language Models have remarkable abilities, roughly corresponding to our *intuition*.
    - They can reason by analogy.
    - This includes mixing and matching concepts from different domains.
    - They are excellent at Natural Language.
    - They are familiar with a huge amount of stuff.
    - They can transfer knowledge from one domain to another.
* However, they are weak at technical work, such as calculations.
* More seriously, they are very poor at judging correctness - both logical and empirical.
* Copilot and other program synthesis tools are very useful, but their output cannot be trusted.
* Reasoning models such as Minerva are quite impressive, but without being able to check which answers are correct their use is limited, as is their training and development.
* A natural way around this is to generate code for interactive theorem provers, which can be checked.
* There are also many ways in which to improve accuracy by giving good prompts such as related examples, *chain of thought*.
