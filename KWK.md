__Title:__ "Automating Mathematics?"

## Abstract

Starting with just the rules of chess, it took four hours of playing against itself for AlphaZero, a computer program, to become the strongest chess player on the planet, playing with a "dynamic, open style" and preferring moves that are "risky and aggressive". With a couple of days of self-play, AlphaZero discovered the best standard openings, and even discarded a few of them. Could a future computer program, starting with adding and multiplying natural numbers, discover the mysteries of the primes?

We discuss the many recent developments that point to such a future. These range from the phenomenal advances in Artificial Intelligence, to advances in the foundations of mathematics, to mathematical proofs making trains safer.

## Outline

* The Quest: table with Chess, Go, Mathematics
* Mathematics
  * prime numbers
  * three questions: infinitude, APs, twin primes
  * why: concepts
  * example: Curvature and Relativity
* Puzzles
  * Solution (answer with justification) hard to find, easy to check.
  * Examples: jigsaw, rubik's cube, detective stories, orbits of planets.
  * formal and informal solutions.
* Reasoning for puzzles
  * deductive/algorithmic: small number of steps following a small number of rules (which may depend on a small number of parameters).
  * intuition
    * not deductive
    * based on experience
    * correct often enough to be useful: a _hunch_ is sometimes correct, a _judgement_ is usually correct.
  * checking a solution must be deductive, but finding one efficiently involves a mix of deduction and intuition.
  * tacit knowledge and expert systems

* Mathematical proof: justification of a mathematical statement.
  * based on the rules of logic.
  * rules of logic are sound (and complete).
  * so far as we know, they are also consistent, and can express everything in the real world.
* Infinitude of primes
  * informal proof
  * formal proof.
* Games and computers
  * teaching a computer to play chess
  * deep Blue vs Kasparov
  * the tradeoff and Go
  * AlphaGo vs Lee Seedol and Ki Jie
  * AlphaGoZero
  * AlphaZero in chess
  * conclusions of reasoning
* GQNs and composition/analogy : factorizes colour, shape and size.
* Computer mathematical proofs
  * four colour problem
  * Robins conjecture
  * Kepler conjecture
  * Pythogorean triples
  * About these:
    * deductive, often domain specific
    * not "solutions" - not easy to verify, hence learn from.
* Interactive theorem provers
  * verify and complete proofs
  * trusted kernel
  * can have significant automation
  * used in formal methods
* Formal methods
  * Some errors: Pentium bug, TimSort, Pegasus attack on WhatsApp
  * Escaped extensive testing as they are in corner cases
  * Still matter
    * safety critical
    * vulnerability
  * __Solution:__
    * Mathematically prove correctness, with the help of and verified by computers
    * This is facilitated by better foundations: allowing composition.
* Where we are:
  * computers purely deductively can still better human mixed approach, but with the cost of proofs not useful to learn from.
  * some deep learning has been used together with these.
  * but in other domains, AI shows intuition, _originality_ and _analogical/compositional thinking_
* Conclusion: Open AI.
